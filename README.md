# Movie-Recommendation-System
This a a project on content based Movie Recommendation System.
The dataset is taken from TMDB movie datasets.
In the model, Tfidf vectorizer is used to transform text to feature vectors that can be used as input to Recommender Function.
The Website has been created using Python's Streamlit library.
It had been deployed on Streamlit Cloud but now since my Git LFS Quota has been finished and I can't create a repo of size >100MB.
