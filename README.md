# Movie-Recommendation-System
This a a project on content based Movie Recommendation System.
The dataset is taken from TMDB movie datasets.
In the model, Tfidf vectorizer is used to transform text to feature vectors that can be used as input to Recommender Function.
The Website has been created using Python's Streamlit library.
It had been deployed on Streamlit Cloud but now since my Git LFS Quota has been finished and all my files got dissappered. Thankfully I had the local copies with me.
Now, I can't create a repo of size >100MB. Hence I had to remove the cosine_similarities.pkl file, movies_data.pkl file (which were earlier needed to launch a streamlit webapp) and the two datasets which were taking close to 300 MB space.
